- **General Layout Considerations**
  - The entire layout is divided into two main sections, left and right, with the content centered in both sections.
  - There's a clear visual hierarchy, with headings being the largest and most prominent, followed by subheadings, and then the body text.
  - The color scheme is minimal, likely with contrasts to distinguish between different elements (text, background, buttons).
  - Alignment: Text and elements are aligned to create a tidy and structured appearance.
  - Spacing: Adequate spacing between elements to avoid a cluttered look and enhance readability.
